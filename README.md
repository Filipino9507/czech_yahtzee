# Czech Yahtzee
 Czech version of the Yahtzee game with extra rules, powerups, server
 and matchmaking. It includes six dice instead of five, which implies different
 scoring rules, as well as the capacity to save dice rolls, which adds more
 strategy.

 Matchmaking using game code generation is the way to play, for 2-4 players.
