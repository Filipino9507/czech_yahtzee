# Czech Yahtzee
Czech version of the Yahtzee game with extra rules, powerups, server
and matchmaking. It includes six dice instead of five, which implies different
scoring rules, as well as the capacity to save dice rolls, which adds more
strategy.

Game can be played over the internet, matchmaking ensured via generated game codes. A single match can be played by 2-4 players.

To run the server, run `npm run dev` (after running `npm i`) in the server/ directory.
To run the client, run `npm run dev` (after running `npm i`) in the client/ directory.
